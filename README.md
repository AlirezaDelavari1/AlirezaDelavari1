### Hi there 👋 It’s Alireza :) 

- 👨‍🎓 I am an Energy engineering bachelor's student at Tehran Polytechnic (Amirkabir University of Technology(AUT)).
- ⚡️ I am passionate about technology and energy, and I am particularly interested in exploring the intersection of these fields. I also love multidisciplinary projects and have a strong interest in artificial intelligence(AI).
- 🧠🤖 In my opinion, **AI** has the potential to transform everything and it can be integrated into industries to make them more efficient and smart. By integrating AI into **energy and power systems**, we can combat **climate change** and prevent energy-related issues. This can contribute to a better future for all.
- 🔍 I’m interested in research and I am actively seeking research and PhD positions in these areas, I am excited to collaborate with other researchers and professionals who share my interests. 
- 🔭 I’m working on some research projects and hopefully publishing them.
- 🌱📚 I am studying machine learning, reinforcement learning, control systems, power and energy systems modeling and optimization, and other related topics. I am eager to apply this knowledge to my research and contribute to the development of innovative solutions.
